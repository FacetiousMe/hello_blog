        "Here we're using link_to in a different way. We pass the named route as the second argument, and then the
        options as another argument. The :method and :'data-confirm' options are used as HTML5 attributes so that
        when the link is clicked, Rails will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link with
        method delete. This is done via the JavaScript file jquery_ujs which is automatically included into your
        application's layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) when you generated the application. Without
        this file, the confirmation dialog box wouldn't appear."
